<h2>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>


<p>The object of this publication is to preserve an
account of the Celebration, at Queenston Heights,
of the Brock Centenary, in a more convenient and
permanent form than that afforded by the reports
(admirable as they are) in the local newspapers.</p>

<p>Celebrations were held in several places in Ontario,
notably at St. Thomas, where Dr. J. H. Coyne
delivered a fervently patriotic address. Had reports
of these been available, extended reference
would have been gladly and properly accorded to
them in this book. Considerable effort, involving
delay in publication, was made to secure the name
of every person who attended at Queenston Heights
in a representative capacity, and the list is probably
complete.</p>

<p>For valuable assistance acknowledgment is due
to Colonel Ryerson, Chairman of the General and
Executive Committees; to Miss Helen M. Merrill,
Honorary Secretary, and to Mr. Angus Claude Macdonell,
K.C., M.P., Toronto. Also to Mr. Walter
R. Nursey, for the use of the pictures of General
Brock, Col. Macdonell, and Brock's Monument,
from his interesting work: "The Story of Brock,"
in the Canadian Heroes Series; and to the Ontario
Archives, Toronto, for the use of the picture of the
first monument erected to Brock on Queenston
Heights.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>BROCK AND QUEENSTON<br />

<small>By John Stewart Carstairs, B.A., Toronto</small></h3>


<p>Brock's fame and Brock's name will never die
in our history. The past one hundred years have
settled that. And in this glory the craggy heights
of Queenston, where in their splendid mausoleum
Brock and Macdonell sleep side by side their last
sleep, will always have its share. Strangely
enough, who ever associates Brock's name with
Detroit? Yet, here was a marvellous achievement:
the left wing of the enemy's army annihilated, its
eloquent and grandiose leader captured and two
thousand five hundred men and abundant military
stores, with the State of Michigan thrown in!</p>

<p>But Britain in those days was so busy doing
things that we a hundred years later can scarcely
realize them. However, so much of our historic
perspective has been settled during the past hundred
years. Perhaps in another hundred years,
when other generations come together to commemorate
the efforts of these men that with Brock and
Macdonell strove to seek and find and do and not
to yield, the skirmish at Queenston may be viewed
in a different light.</p>

<p>Perhaps then the British Constitution will have
bridged the oceans and the "Seven Seas"; perhaps
then Canada will be more British than
Britain itself&mdash;the very core, the centre, the heart
of the Empire in territory and population, in
wealth and in influence, in spirit and in vital activities.
Then Queenston Heights may be regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
not merely as a victory that encouraged Canadians
to fight for their homes but as a far-reaching
world-event.</p>

<p>The year of Queenston, let us remember, was the
year of Salamanca and of Moscow&mdash;the most glorious
year in British military annals. But what has
Salamanca to do with Canada? Britain was fighting
alone, not merely for the freedom of Britons but
for the freedom of Europe. Since 1688 she had
been for more than one-half of the one hundred and
twenty-four years actively in arms against France.
Since 1793 there had been peace&mdash;and only nominal
peace&mdash;<i>against</i> France for only the two years
following the Treaty of Amiens (1801). The generation
approaching maturity in 1812 had been
born and had grown up "in wars and rumours of
wars." In this struggle against France and later
against Napoleon, the Motherland had increased
the National Debt by &#163;500,000,000, or nearly
twenty-five hundred millions of dollars; she had
spent every cent she could gather and taxed her
posterity to this extent. That is what Britain had
done for her children&mdash;and for the world at large!</p>

<p>But ever since Jefferson had purchased (1803)
Louisiana from Napoleon the United States had
found she was less dependent on Britain. Accordingly,
Jefferson grew more and more unfriendly.
And now in 1812, the world campaign of Napoleon
had spread to America. He had hoped for this, but
on different lines. He had planned for it, but those
plans had failed.</p>

<p>"The War of 1812-14," as we call it, was merely
a phase, a section, of the greatest struggle in
the history of mankind&mdash;the struggle of Britain
against the aggrandisement and cheap ambition of
Napoleon to become the Dictator of Europe and
the civilized world. Brock, though invited to take
a share in the long drawn out contest in Spain,
decided&mdash;fortunately for us&mdash;to remain in Canada.</p>

<p>The year 1812 was the climax of the war with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Napoleon&mdash;the most splendid, as we have said, of
all years in British military annals. Since 1808,
the British forces had been striving to drive the
French from Spain. First under Sir John Moore,
later under Wellington, inch by inch, year by year,
they had beaten them back toward the Pyrenees.
Then on July 22, 1812, just as Brock was struggling
with all his difficulties here in Canada, there
came Wellington's first decisive victory at Salamanca.
The news reached Brock in October and
a day or two before he died he sent the tidings
forward to Proctor&mdash;Proctor then struggling with
his Forty-first Regiment to do as much damage as
he could to the enemy hundreds of miles out from
Windsor and Detroit, Proctor who was to be eternally
much abused for faults he never was guilty of,
and to be blamed for Tecumseh's death next year.
With the news of Salamanca went Brock's prophetic
comment: "I think the game nearly up in
Spain"; and within a year the game, Napoleon's
game, was up, not only in Spain but in all Europe.
Within a year Leipsic had been fought and won
and Napoleon was a wanderer on the face of the
earth, to be gathered in and lodged on Elba.</p>

<p>Meanwhile other great events were shaping.
Just a month before Salamanca&mdash;in fact, four days
before the United States declared war&mdash;Napoleon
had set out on his fatal expedition against Russia.
Two days later he crossed the Niemen. More than
a million Frenchmen were now in arms in Europe;
and Britain was the only active enemy in the field.</p>

<p>What wonder then that Brock, as the civil and
military head of the Government of Upper Canada,
should view with extreme anxiety the situation in
the Province? He had been in Canada for ten
years. He knew that the Motherland could not
furnish any more men. There were fifteen hundred
regular troops in Upper, and two thousand in
Lower Canada. Forty years before there had not
been a single settlement in what is now Ontario<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
from the Detroit to the Ottawa, from Lake Ontario
to Sault Ste. Marie. Now there were seventy-five
thousand inhabitants; and under a wise Militia
Act they had imposed yearly military service on
themselves; every male inhabitant had to furnish
his own gun and appear on parade or be heavily
fined. Thus there was a volunteer force more or
less trained amounting to about ten thousand men&mdash;a
militia that under Brock rendered splendid
service.</p>

<p>But arms were scarce and supplies had to be
brought long distances. The men at Queenston
won their victory with guns that were captured
two months before at Detroit. Throughout the
war, when our mills had been burnt by a ruthless
enemy that made war on women and children and
old men, supplies were brought up the toilsome
course of the St. Lawrence in Durham boats and
<i>bateaux</i>. The devoted militia of the river counties
guarded the frontier, and only once did they lose
a convoy, part of which they afterwards recovered
by a raid into the enemy's territory at Waddington,
N.Y.</p>

<p>In front of Brock was a nation of eight or nine
millions, a nation that believed they could "take
the Canadas without soldiers;" as the United
States Secretary of War said&mdash;"we have only to
send officers into the Province and the people, disaffected
towards their own Government, will rally
round our standard." Yet they placed, during the
three years of the war, 527,000 men in the field and
were defeated in thirty-two engagements. The
odds were twenty-six to one against us. That was
Brock's grand bequest to this land&mdash;the spirit to
fight against odds that were at first sight positively
overwhelming.</p>

<p>For years sedition and disloyalty had been gaining
ground in Upper Canada. In 1802, Colonel
Talbot classified the inhabitants of the western
part of the Province as (1) those enticed hither by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the free land grants; (2) those that had fled from
the United States for crime; (3) Republicans anticipating
that the colony would shake off its
allegiance to Britain. Lieutenant-Colonel Ernest
Cruikshank, who is justly regarded as the most
eminent authority on the War of 1812-14, believes
that in a large portion of the Province "the recent
immigrants from the United States outnumbered
all the other inhabitants at least two to one. Two-thirds
of the members of the Assembly and one-third
of the magistrates were natives of the United
States."</p>

<p>On the 28th of July, 1812, Brock called together
the Legislature of Upper Canada. In his speech
from the throne he stated that "a few traitors have
already joined the enemy, have been suffered to
come into the country with impunity, and have
been harboured and concealed in the interior."
The peroration should be memorized by every
young Canadian: "We are engaged in an awful
and eventful contest. By unanimity and despatch
in our councils and by vigour in our operations we
may teach the enemy this lesson, that a country
defended by <i>free men</i>, enthusiastically devoted to
their king and constitution, can never be conquered."
He especially desired the suspension of
the Habeas Corpus Act and the passing of an Act
to compel suspected persons to take an oath abjuring
their allegiance to other countries. But Brock,
to use his own words, could "get no good of them.
They, like the magistrates and others in office, evidently
mean to remain passive. The repeal of the
Habeas Corpus will not pass, and if I have recourse
to the law martial, I am told the whole armed
force will disperse. Never was an officer placed
in a more awkward predicament."</p>

<p>The very next day he wrote in much the same
spirit to Colonel Baynes: "The population, believe
me, is essentially bad&mdash;a full belief possesses them
all that this Province must inevitably succumb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
This prepossession is fatal to every exertion. Legislators,
magistrates, militia officers, all have
imbibed the idea, and are so sluggish and indifferent
in their respective offices that the artful and
active scoundrel is allowed to parade the country
without interruption and commit all imaginable
mischief.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Most of the people have lost all
confidence. I, however, speak loud and look big."</p>

<p>On the same day, moreover, he reported: "The
militia stationed here (at York) volunteered their
services to any part of the Province without the
least hesitation."</p>

<p>Day after day his Legislature wasted their time.
For eight days they discussed a mere party question
of changing a clause in the School Bill. Brock
prorogued Parliament and took the reins in his
own hands. He declared martial law, and soon
after three members of the Legislature, Willcocks,
Markle, and Mallory, deserted and joined the United
States forces.</p>

<p>At once he set out on his expedition to Detroit.
Through the wilds of Upper Canada, by lake and
field, he led his small band of men two hundred
miles. In nineteen days he was back again in his
capital. He had annihilated the left wing of the
enemy's army; he had captured two thousand five
hundred men, thirty-seven cannon and immense
military stores. The State of Michigan practically
remained in our possession till the close of the war.</p>

<p>A hundred years ago Brock spent the last week
in August and the first part of October in strengthening
the defences on the Niagara frontier. He
needed one thousand more regulars, but Sir George
Prevost could not spare another man. He mounted
new batteries with the Detroit cannon. He established
a system of communication and the use of
beacon lights from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, with
a spur line inland to Pelham Heights. He refitted
his men from the stores captured at Detroit. Ceaseless
activity and eternal vigilance were the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
laws of his life. The motto on his seal is said to
have been "He who guards never sleeps." The
legend may not be correct, but it is so appropriate
that one likes to perpetuate the tradition.</p>

<p>The United States army as a whole was attacking
Canada at three points: its right wing was
trying to force its way up the valley of the Richelieu;
its left wing had been disposed of by Brock
at Detroit; its centre was being strengthened every
day along the Niagara frontier. From the old
French fort at the mouth of the Niagara River to
the village of Buffalo there was on both sides of
the Niagara an uninterrupted scene of fearful and
warlike activity. The heights of Lewiston and the
red beach below were white with the tents of nearly
four thousand soldiers.</p>

<p>From Queenston a small body of British and
Canadian soldiers were watching and waiting.
Then&mdash;a hundred years ago&mdash;it was much the same
straggling village as to-day. Here the eddying,
foaming, turbulent waters of the Niagara issue
from the narrow, rocky gorge to spread out into a
gentle stream and wind their way to Lake Ontario,
seven miles distant. At the foot of the Canadian
cliff nestles Queenston; at the foot of the sister
cliff opposite is Lewiston in New York State. A
hundred years ago, from the "Heights" a spectator
would have seen the same glorious panorama
of fertile fields and autumn tints; but since June
the whole line of the Niagara River had resounded
with din of preparations to resist a ruthless and
aggressive invader.</p>

<p>But while Brock was absent at Detroit, about
the middle of August, Sir George Prevost, the
British commander-in-chief, had very unwisely
concluded an armistice with General Dearborn,
the terms of which extended only to the right wing
of the United States army. Accordingly, this gave
Major-General Van Rensselaer, who was in command
of the enemy on the Niagara, a splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
opportunity to array still larger forces against
Brock. Artillery and stores were brought up from
Oswego; thousands of additional troops had been
hurried forward to the enemy; scows and boats
were built for the purpose of crossing the Niagara.</p>

<p>"Major-General Stephen Van Rensselaer," says
Colonel Ernest Cruikshank, the careful historian
of the war, "who held chief command by virtue of
his rank as major-general of the New York State
troops, was an entire novice in all military affairs,
and could scarcely even be termed an amateur
soldier. The last patroon of the manor of Rensselaer-Wyck
and the leading Federalist in the
State, his appointment was a sharp stroke of party
tactics on the part of the Governor, who discovered
in him a prospective and dangerous opponent. The
recent congressional elections had seemed to indicate
that the Federalists had regained the confidence
of the people of New York, and most of their
leaders were uncompromising in their hostility to
the war. If Van Rensselaer accepted the command
his immediate following would be committed to its
prosecution; if he refused his conduct could be
denounced as unpatriotic.</p>

<p>"Stephen was an amiable and benevolent, but
rather dull man of about fifty years of age. On
all strictly military subjects he was compelled to
rely upon the advice of his adjutant-general and
cousin, Colonel Solomon Van Rensselaer, who had
been bred a soldier, had served in the United States
army for ten years, and had held his present
appointment for as many more. He had been
wounded in Wayne's campaign against the
Indians, and possessed the reputation of being a
brave and skilful officer."</p>

<p>The close observer who comes up the Niagara
River will see just after he leaves the wharf of
Niagara-on-the-Lake the far-extending green bastions
of Fort George. A hundred years ago there
was no barn there which a thrifty Government later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
allowed to be built within its lines. But a hundred
years ago this morning, on Tuesday, October 13,
it was a fort and Brock's headquarters. For weeks
there had been persistent rainstorms. In the dull
grey foggy chill of the morning, about four o'clock,
there came an alarm that the enemy were crossing
the river at Queenston. In a few minutes, Brock
dashed out of the fort unattended and galloped
headlong up the river road. Macdonell, his young
and faithful aide-de-camp, soon followed. At
Brown's Point, two miles from Queenston, was a
battery manned by the militia of York, among
them such men as John Beverley Robinson and
Archibald Maclean, both afterwards chief justices.
As Brock passed he waved his hand to them; and
very likely it was then he said, "Push on, brave
York Volunteers." And as they advanced to support
their leaders there was plenty of evidence that
the invaders had made a landing. Troops of the
enemy were met under guard&mdash;miserable, wounded
wretches.</p>

<p>The mouth of the Niagara Gorge is barely two
hundred yards wide; and this had been selected
as the place at which to cross. Fifteen hundred
United States regulars and nearly three thousand
militia, it was hoped, could be ferried across in
seven trips. At Queenston to oppose them there
were merely two companies of the Forty-ninth
(Brock's regiment) under Captain Dennis, and
three companies of militia. In all, in and about
Queenston there were less than two hundred men.</p>

<p>In less than fifteen minutes ten boats had landed
three hundred men, exactly as they had planned.
When discovered by a sentinel, they were forming
up under the command of Colonel Solomon Van
Rensselaer.</p>

<p>At once from Brown's Point, from Vrooman's
Point, from the gun halfway up Queenston Heights
there belched forth an incessant fire. The Lewiston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
batteries opened on the village and soon
reduced several of the houses to ruins.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Captain Dennis, with forty-six men,
sought out the invaders at the foot of the cliff.
Though they soon took to the cover of the trees
and brush in disorder, many were killed, and
Colonel Van Rensselaer himself received no less
than six wounds.</p>

<p>After dawn, however, they observed how few
men were working the one-gun battery halfway up
Queenston Heights. They ascended by a narrow
fisherman's path, under the command of Lieutenant
Wool, and gained the Heights unopposed.</p>

<p>It was "at this instant Brock rode into the village,
splashed with mud from head to foot.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
A striking scene presented itself to his gaze. Battalion
after battalion of troops in rear of the
American batteries in readiness to embark; other
detachments entering their boats, some already on
the river; their guns throwing round and grape
shot into the village, where Dennis still contrived
to maintain a foothold" (Cruikshank).</p>

<p>Brock rode up the slope toward the redan halfway
up the Heights. From the hillside above him
burst a shout and down rushed an overwhelming
body of the invaders. With barely time to spike
the gun with a ramrod, the three officers and the
dozen artillerymen withdrew and left the enemy in
possession.</p>

<p>Fresh troops were now landing to assist the
invaders; and Brock was fully convinced that the
lost position must be recovered at once. He sent
Captain Williams with about seventy men by a
round-about way to attack Wool's left. Seeing
Wool's force driven in, Brock mustered a hundred
and ninety men, including the militia flank companies.
Waving his sword, he led his men up the
steep ascent toward the battery they had lost. As
he moved toward the right of the mountain, a bullet
struck his sword wrist. Within fifty yards of him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
an Ohio rifleman stepped out from a thicket, took
deliberate aim and fired. Shot through the left
breast, he fell. "My fall," he murmured, "must
not be noticed, nor impede my brave companions
from advancing to victory." Mindful of duty,
mindful of others, thus died Sir Isaac Brock, the
hero of Upper Canada.</p>

<p>Three days before, a grateful sovereign had
created him a Knight of the Order of the Bath.
Subsequent generations of Canadians placed over
his remains the noble shaft, that from its commanding
position is the most notable landmark of
the historic battleground he made famous. But he
lives in the hearts of the people whose country he
saved, whose fathers he inspired to resist the
invader. He had found them a panic-stricken
people, he left them vigorous, united, aggressive.</p>

<p>The remaining incidents of that day at Queenston
Heights are well known. Two hours later,
Macdonell, Brock's military secretary and aide,
tried to regain the one-gun battery. A fierce fight
ensued: Macdonell, Dennis and Williams were all
wounded; and the next day the bright young
Scotsman, attorney-general at the age of twenty-seven,
passed away. In life he was united with
Brock, and in death he was not separated. The
bodies of the two heroes rest together under the
Queenston Monument, where the river has been
singing their requiem for a hundred years.</p>

<p>The third stage of the battle was reached at two
o'clock in the afternoon. Then Major-General
Roger Hale Sheaffe advanced from Fort George
along the river road. Turning to the right down
the little Queenston Creek, he led his forces across
the Dr. Hamilton property. On the left he flung
out his Indians under Norton and Brant, and they
moved forward and made trouble.</p>

<p>Ascending the escarpment west of the invading
troops, Sheaffe came upon the terrified invaders,
drawn up near the site of the present monument.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Their left rested on the river verge of the cliff. A
volley or two&mdash;and the Canadians found themselves
embarrassed with prisoners. Within a few
days, 958, including stragglers, had surrendered as
prisoners of war. Among these were General Wadsworth,
who had been in command, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Winfield Scott, later to become commander-in-chief
of the United States army and conqueror of
Mexico.</p>

<h3>PRELIMINARY STEPS</h3>


<p>The desire to commemorate the centenary of
Brock's death-day&mdash;October 13th, 1912&mdash;took form
at a meeting of the United Empire Loyalists' Association
of Canada, held at Toronto on April 11th,
1912, when, on the motion of Mr. John Stewart
Carstairs, B.A., a committee, consisting of Colonel
Ryerson, Lieut.-Colonel W. Hamilton Merritt, Mr.
J. S. Carstairs, and Mr. C. E. MacDonald, barrister,
was appointed to draft a suitable programme
for the celebration of "Brock's Day."</p>

<p>This committee submitted the following report
at a meeting of the Association held on September
17th, 1912, Colonel Ryerson presiding:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Your Committee begs leave to report that as,
within their knowledge, no action has been taken
by either the Federal or Provincial Government to
celebrate the Centenary of the death of Sir Isaac
Brock on Sunday, October 13th, 1912, they recommend as follows:</p>

<p>"(1) That recommendations be made to both
the Federal Government and to the Provincial Government
of Ontario, that in view of the fact that
General Brock in June, 1812, found himself at the
head of a panic-stricken people in the presence of
a powerful invader, and that a few months later,
when he fell at Queenston Heights, he left that
people united, fearless and invincible, it is believed
that there should be a national demonstration that
will be in effect only less impressive on the public
mind than was the passing away of the man himself
at Queenston Heights a hundred years ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenumbq"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"(2) That the demonstration might take the form
of a royal salute from every cannon in the land on
Sunday, October 13th. This would be a matter to
be arranged by the Minister of Militia.</p>

<p>"(3) Every church in Canada might be requested
to hold some sort of a memorial service
on Sunday, October 13th.</p>

<p>"(4) On Friday, October 11th, every school in
Canada might appeal to the intellect and imagination
of the coming generation of men and women
by appropriate commemorative exercises.</p>

<p>"(5) Monday, October 14th, could be proclaimed
a national holiday.</p>

<p>"There is, in the corridor of the Parliament
Buildings at Toronto, the copy of a splendid portrait
of Brock, full of life and action. By some
arrangement with the Minister of Education in
every Province, or even without it, perhaps a copy
of this picture could be placed in every school in
the land.</p>

<p>"(6) As the city of Toronto is very likely to
expropriate the Knox College property, it might
be well to suggest to the city authorities that this
new park should be opened in October with proper
ceremonies and named Brock Park. In this connection,
it might be well to recall that the lower
portion of Spadina Avenue was, until recently,
known as Brock Street.</p>

<p>"(7) It is recommended that these suggestions
shall be brought to the attention of the Federal
and Provincial Governments, and every means
should be taken to convince the authorities that on
October 13th, 1912, our people should hang some
votive offering on the shrine of the hero of Upper
Canada.</p>

<p>"(8) That copies of this report be sent to the
National Council of Women and to the Secretary
of the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the
Empire inviting their concurrence.</p>

<p class="author">

</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>This Report was adopted tentatively, and in
order to secure as wide as possible a co-operation
from other patriotic Associations, it was agreed,
on the motion of Colonel Denison, seconded by Mr.
C. E. Macdonald, that the Centenary of Sir Isaac
Brock's death, Sunday, October 13th, 1912, be
commemorated by an excursion to Queenston
Heights on the 12th, and that patriotic and historical
societies, clubs and regiments, etc., be asked
to send not more than three delegates to a meeting
to be held on Wednesday, September 25th, at 4.30
o'clock, in the Canadian Foresters' Building, to
discuss a plan of commemoration.</p>

<p>In accordance with this resolution the following
societies were circularized, and asked to co-operate

<h3>REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3>

<p>The General Committee met on October 2nd,
1912, Colonel Ryerson presiding. The reports of
the special committees regarding the arrangements
were very satisfactory, and it was made abundantly
clear that the proposed celebration had
touched a tender chord of public feeling. Travelling
arrangements by train to Niagara Falls and
by electric car thence to Queenston Heights were
approved of. The co-operation of the Women's
Institute, Queenston, was promised in connection
with the decoration of the grounds there; the
Ontario Government consented to police the
grounds, and the Victoria Park Commission to
reopen the restaurant at the Heights for the day.
It was agreed to advise the hotels at Niagara Falls,
Ont., that luncheon would be taken at that town
on arrival of the train, and to arrange with the
electric railway for the conveyance of the visitors
to the Monument. The publicity so generously
afforded by the press was gratefully acknowledged.
A letter from Mr. J. A. Macdonell, K.C., Alexandria,
accepting the Committee's invitation, was
read; and a motion by Mr. F. D. L. Smith that a
bronze tablet to mark the centenary celebration
be placed on Brock's Monument was deferred for
consideration at the next meeting to be held on the
week following.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the General Committee held
on October 9th in the Canadian Foresters' Hall,
Toronto, Colonel Ryerson presiding, the following
report of the Executive Committee was received
and adopted:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Executive Committee met on October 7th
and received satisfactory reports of the progress
made in carrying out the proposals of the
General Committee. A programme for the celebration
at Queenston Heights was drafted, and the
President was requested to arrange with the
Department of Militia that the permanent forces
be sent from Toronto to Queenston Heights to take
part in the proceedings. It was also resolved to
publish an account of the proceedings in connection
with the celebration as an interesting record
of a notable event."</p></div>

<p>The Executive also reported that all arrangements
had been completed for the journey to
Queenston Heights; that the Militia Department
had ordered that salutes be fired from all saluting
points in Canada on the 12th inst.; that commemorative
church services would be extensively held
on the 13th inst.; that special exercises would be
observed in the public schools in accordance with
letters received from the Honourable R. A. Pyne,
M.P.P., Minister of Education for Ontario, Mr.
Augustus W. Ball, Deputy Minister of Education,
Saskatchewan, Mr. Alexander Robinson, Superintendent
of Education, British Columbia, and from
Mr. R. Fletcher, Deputy Minister of Education,
Manitoba; that a detachment from the permanent
infantry force at Toronto would proceed to Queenston
Heights on the 12th inst.; that the Toronto,
Hamilton and other corps of militia would be
represented, and that large delegations from patriotic,
national and historical societies would take
part; that many wreaths would be sent to the
monument; that the Dominion Government had
ordered its representative in London, England, to
place a wreath on Brock's Memorial in St. Paul's
Cathedral; and that letters from prominent public
men had been received, either regretting their
inability to take part or accepting the invitations
to be present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>This being the last meeting of the General Committee,
it was agreed to refer the suggestion that
a bronze centennial tablet be placed on Brock's
Monument, the striking of a Centennial medal,
and all business connected with the celebration
ceremonies, or arising therefrom, to the Executive
Committee, with full power to dispose of the same.</p>

<p>The meeting then adjourned <i>sine die</i>.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<h3>CELEBRATING THE DAY</h3>


<p>It had been decided to travel by the Grand Trunk
Railway train leaving Toronto at nine o'clock a.m.
(a few only going by steamer from Yonge Street
wharf). The unsettled, rainy weather of the two
previous days had caused some misgiving as to the
number of people who might venture on an open
air demonstration on a cold October day, and the
grey looming skies at dawn on Saturday, the 12th,
held no hidden hope of a silver lining. The
enthusiasm awakened by the name of Brock, however,
was resistless, and betimes the seats in the
waiting train were crowded. The Union Station
witnessed a lively scene&mdash;the soldiers in bright
colours, the ladies and gentlemen in gay humour,
and the stirring music of the bagpipes, combining
to enliven and mark the unusual character of the
occasion.</p>

<p>At Hamilton a number of friends joined the
party, and others who could not do so came to the
railway station to express their good wishes. St.
Catharines also gave its contingent. Niagara Falls
was safely reached at 11.45 o'clock.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Major Gordon J. Smith,
Brantford, Superintendent of the Six Nation
Indians, and a fine delegation arrived, and
luncheon was served at several of the hotels.</p>

<p>The journey was resumed by electric cars, the
large company arriving at Queenston Heights in
the course of an hour.</p>

<p>During the forenoon the sky had cleared, and
now the sun shone out brightly for a space on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
landscape unsurpassed anywhere for spacious
magnificence and scenic beauty. And crowning
the domed escarpment the stately column spoke
forth a people's patriotism and love, a memorial
to the brave, the scene harmonizing with the
feelings of the great gathering.</p>

<p><a name="wreaths" id="wreaths"></a>The stirring interest taken by the public in the
celebration was in no way made more apparent
than by the large number of costly and beautiful
floral offerings sent to decorate the monument.
Immediately on assembling on the Heights, these
expressive tributes were formally received, one by
one, by Colonel Ryerson. The names of the givers
were announced by Mr. Chas. E. Macdonald, who
also read out the patriotic mottoes and inscriptions.
The wreaths were then carefully placed on
the monument, and so numerous were they that
they almost covered its huge base. The luxuriant
ivy growing on the lower masonry was richly tinted
with autumnal bronze, and on the natural background
thus unexpectedly provided, the delighted
celebrators worked out an effective colour scheme.
It has not been possible to obtain a complete list
of those who brought wreaths with them, but the
following were noted:</p>

<p>A magnificent Cross of St. George, made of oak
leaves, from the Guernsey Society of Guernsey
Island, Brock's birthplace, was placed on the cenotaph
which marks the place where Brock fell, by
Mr. J. L. Burney, whose father was a lieutenant
under Brock and was by his side when the General
was fatally stricken.</p>

<p>J. A. Macdonell, K.C., Glengarry, A. McLean
Macdonell, K.C., Toronto, and Angus Claude Macdonell,
K.C., M.P., Toronto, as representatives of
the family of Colonel the Honourable John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Macdonell, General Brock's aide-de-camp and military
secretary, placed on the monument two handsome
wreaths of laurel leaves, decorated with white and
pink heather and heavily trimmed with purple, one
to the memory of Brock, and one, with the motto
"From Kith and Kin," to the memory of their
kinsman, Colonel Macdonell.</p>

<p>Miss Ball, granddaughter of Captain John Clement
Ball, carried a lithograph of the battle scene
(Queenston Heights) made in 1813 from a sketch
by Major Dennis as he lay wounded on the field,
October 13th, 1812.</p>

<p>In addition to the wreath placed on the monument
the United Empire Loyalists hung a wreath
on the portrait of General Brock in the Parliament
Buildings, Toronto.</p>

<p><a name="scene" id="scene"></a>The scene presented was unique, and in many
respects a remarkable one. Not the least striking
feature was the character of the gathering.
Descendants of soldiers who fought with Brock
were there, some of them carrying the burden of
years, some barely out of childhood's leash. Others,
and scarcely less interested in the proceedings,
represented loyal and patriotic societies, widely
spread over the Province. The Indian contingent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
from the Six Nations occupied a conspicuous place
of honour most worthily, their presence recalling
the signal service rendered by their brave forefathers
at Queenston Heights and in the campaign
generally. The military detachments added colour
to the animated scene. The men of the Royal Canadian
Regiment, of the Governor-General's Body
Guard, of the Forty-eighth Highlanders, the
Queen's Own, the Royal Grenadiers, the Mississauga
Horse, the Ridley College Cadets, and of
other corps, were drawn up on the outside of the
crowd, and beyond them, on the escarpment, the
St. Catharines' Battery, Field Artillery, was stationed.
Over all floated the Union Jack.</p>

<p><a name="flags" id="flags"></a>An incident of the gathering in which much interest
was shown was the unfurling of an old, historic
Union Jack from the top of Brock's Monument by
Miss Helen M. Merrill, Secretary of the Committee.
When the first monument erected to Brock at
Queenston was destroyed (17th April, 1840) a
great indignation meeting was held on the
Heights. Among those present was a British
sailor from one of the ships that conveyed the
Toronto people to the meeting. He had brought
with him a Union Jack, and climbing to the top
of the broken shaft, waved it aloft, amid the cheers
of the assembled patriots. The flag was preserved,
and Mr. Comer, Kingston, Ont., readily
loaned it for this special occasion. Accompanying
Miss Merrill to the top of the monument with the
flag were Misses Marjorie FitzGibbon and Laura
Brodigan and Mr. Allen W. Johnson (Six
Nations).</p>

<p>Several relics of the War of 1812-14 were shown
by their possessors, who held them sacred, among
them a Union Jack, carried by Chief Paudash
(Johnson) of the Mississauga Indians, from the
Ontario Archives Department; early sketches of
the Queenston battlefield, and pictures of officers
who took part in the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>At the close of the speeches the Six Nation
Indians present formed a Council, and, in recognition
of her services as Honorary Secretary of the
Celebration Committee, conferred on Miss Helen M.
Merrill the honour of tribal membership by the
name "Kah-ya-tonhs"&mdash;one who keeps records.</p>

<p>The wreaths having been placed, the programme
of the day was opened by the firing of a general
salute by the 7th St. Catharines Field Battery of
the Royal Canadian Artillery. This was followed
by the playing of a lament for the dead by the
pipers of the Forty-eighth Highlanders and Pipe-Major
Dunbar, piper to Lieut.-Colonel William
Hendrie, of Hamilton.</p>

<h2>THE SPEECHES</h2>

by a number of well known gentlemen whose
speeches follow:</p>

<p><a name="Ryerson" id="Ryerson"></a></p>
<h3>COLONEL G. STERLING RYERSON<br />

<small>Chairman of the General Committee</small></h3>

<p>This meeting to-day is held to commemorate the
death of a brave and wise man who died in the defence
of his country. It is not a pean of victory we
sing but a requiem. We are not here to glorify war;
nor is our object to exult over our brave but
defeated adversary. Rather is it an occasion when
Canadians should pause and look back over the
past and give praise to God that in the days of
stress and storm He raised up great, good and
brave men who were willing and able to fight for
their king and country in order that they might
enjoy civil and religious liberty under the British
flag, and that they might hand down to their posterity
a fair and goodly heritage which they had won
from the primeval forests by their labour and sacrifices.
The United Empire Loyalists came to this
country not as those who desired to better their
condition in life, nor were they possessed by land
hunger, nor by ideas of political and social aggrandisement.
They came solely because of their devotion
to the British Crown and Constitution, and
because they preferred to live in peace and poverty
under a monarchical Government rather than in
wealth and discord under republican institutions.
It was to these men that Brock appealed, nor did
he appeal in vain when war was declared. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
on July 27th, 1812, that in reply to an address
from the Assembly of Upper Canada he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Gentlemen: When invaded by an enemy whose
avowed object is the entire conquest of the Province,
the voice of loyalty as well as of interest
calls aloud to every person in the sphere in which
he is placed, to defend his country. Our militia
have heard the voice and have obeyed it. They
have evinced by the promptitude and loyalty of
their conduct that they are worthy of the king
whom they serve, and of the constitution which
they enjoy; and it affords me particular satisfaction,
that while I address you as legislators, I speak
to men who, in the day of danger, will be ready to
assist not only with their counsel, but with arms."</p>

<p>He concluded as follows: "We are engaged in
an awful and eventful contest. By unanimity and
despatch in our councils, and by vigour in our
operations, we may teach the enemy this lesson,
that a country defended by free men, enthusiastically
devoted to the cause of their king and constitution,
can never be conquered."</p></div>

<p>We know the response, and others who will follow
me will speak of it in greater detail. With
the Canadian poet we can say and sing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We boast not of the victory,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But render homage, deep and just,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To his and their immortal dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who proved so worthy of their trust&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No lofty pile nor sculptured bust<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Can herald their degree.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No tongue need blazon forth their fame&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The cheers that stir the sacred hill<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are but the promptings of the will<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That conquered then, that conquers still;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And generations yet shall thrill<br /></span>
<span class="i3">At Brock's remembered name."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Nor must it be supposed that the United Empire
Loyalists and their children were the only men
who responded to Brock's call to arms. Our
gallant French-Canadian compatriots were not a
whit behind in their hearty response. Coming from
a brave and adventurous race, they performed
deeds of valour and endurance equal to the best in
the defence of our country. The hardy Highlanders
of Glengarry, too, were rallied to the flag by
the Macdonells. Not the least active among these
Scottish Roman Catholic Loyalists was the Rev.
Alexander Macdonell, a priest who afterwards
became the "Good Bishop," a brave and loyal man
whose country's welfare was ever near to his heart.
Another Macdonell, George, was second in command
of the Glengarry Regiment, and still another,
Colonel John Macdonell, was aide-de-camp to
Brock in addition to being Attorney-General of
the Province. He, alas, lost his life in his gallant
efforts to second his chief at this battle which we
commemorate to-day. Scotsmen are ever brave
and loyal, and we have in the Scottish population
of the country an element on whom we can rely in
time of danger.</p>

<p>Let us not forget that we owe not a little to our
Indian allies in the War of 1812. Tecumseh and
Brant played great parts. Nor was Brock niggardly
in his praise. After the fall of Detroit he
says in his despatch to the Governor-General:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The conduct of the Indians, under Colonel
Elliot, Captain McKee and other officers of the
department, joined to that of the gallant and brave
of their respective tribes, has since the commencement
of the war been marked with acts of true
heroism, and in nothing can they testify more
strongly their love for their King, their great
Father, than in following the dictates of honour
and humanity by which they have hitherto been
actuated."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>Why do we single out Brock as a hero among so
many who have rendered good service to the country?
I think that it is because he was a man of
loyalty, vigour, energy and administrative ability;
because he was the embodiment of the patriotism
and loyalty of the people; because he had within
him the power to inspire others with the spirit
of patriotism and self-sacrifice; and above and
beyond all, it is due to his efforts, and to the spirit
of resistance and Imperialism to which he gave
form and substance, that Canada to-day is an
integral part of the British Empire, and a daughter
nation within that great galaxy of the nations
known as the British Empire.</p>

<p>What does it mean to be a British citizen? What
benefits accrue to us by having this status? Are
not the paths of the sea open to us and to our commerce
by the grace of the British navy? Can we
not go to all parts of the world as individuals,
knowing that the Union Jack protects us? Is it
a small privilege to share in the brave deeds of the
British army? Are we not proud of our common
literature, and are not Shakespeare and Milton
and Tennyson our very own? Not borrowed
plumes we are wearing, but our own. And are not
the benefits of British civil, religious and political
liberty ours also? Is not British justice and
administration of the law something to be proud
of and to be thankful for? What should we do to
maintain our status as a partner, a full partner,
in the Imperial concern? Is it not our bounden
duty to contribute directly to the support of the
British navy? Are we to lag behind the other self-governing
nations of the Empire in this essential
duty? A thousand times No! A Government
which will subscribe twenty-five millions of dollars
for this purpose, and at once, can go to the polls
in perfect confidence when their time comes to ask
the people for their verdict.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Some good people seem to think that the time
of universal peace is at hand. One has only to
look at the state of affairs in Europe on this very
day, to perceive how far we are removed from the
millennium. In time of peace we must prepare for
war; preparation for war is the best insurance
policy against it. We wish to live at peace with
all nations, but at all costs and at all hazards we
must defend our shores. Universal military service
is the duty of the Canadian people in the near
future. The people will be better for it morally
and physically. It will surely come, for the policy
of the future is the maintenance of the integrity of
the British Empire. We love our country, we
believe it has a great future; we must make it
secure. What says a sweet singer of Canada:</p>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O strong hearts guarding the birthright of our glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Worth your best blood this heritage ye guard:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Those mighty streams resplendent with story,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">These iron coasts by rage of seas unjarred&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What fields of peace these bulwarks well secure:<br /></span>
<span class="i3">What vales of plenty these calm floods supply:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shall not our love this rough, sweet land make sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Her bounds preserve inviolate, though we die:<br /></span>
<span class="i5">O strong hearts of the North<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Let flame your loyalty forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And put the craven and the base to open shame<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Till earth shall know the Child of Nations by her Name."</span>

<h3>MR. ANGUS CLAUDE MACDONELL, M.P.<br />

<small>Toronto</small></h3>

<p>We have gathered here to-day as Canadians
to commemorate an event which will be ever
dear to us and our posterity. One hundred
years ago Sir Isaac Brock, the hero of Upper
Canada, died in battle upon this field in
defence of his country and the flag. In the past
we have learned and heard altogether too little
of this truly great man, and of what he accomplished;
it is not too much to say that he preserved
Canada to the Empire and at the same time created
a national sentiment in Canada which has ever
grown and expanded to the present day. The
national importance of the battle of Queenston
Heights, following the capitulation of Detroit, cannot
be over-estimated; national sentiment or a feeling
of nationhood was even then manifesting itself
in this young colony. The peoples who had settled
in Canada sprang from races which had always
stood out strongly for national identity&mdash;the English
glory in their historic past; the Scottish race,
to which my forefathers belonged and which to
some extent I represent, on this occasion, are noted
for their love of country; and so with the other
races which made up the United Empire Loyalist
settlers of Upper Canada at the time of the War
of 1812-14. Our national heart was created and
stirred in this century-old war, and the heartbeats
have ever become stronger down to this day, and
we now look back through the mists of one hundred
years to Sir Isaac Brock as the first true source of
national sentiment which fertilized our country,
and stamped it as British and Canadian forever.</p>

<p>Our object in coming here to-day, after we have
enjoyed one hundred years of blessed peace with
our neighbours to the south, is not to perpetuate
national hostility, or even to cherish a mere military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
spirit; we hope and pray and fully believe that
this peace will ever exist between us and our
American brothers. Our object in coming here
to-day is to honour the name and memory of one
who was chiefly instrumental in bringing about
that blessed peace, and in preserving our country
to enjoy it; and in the name of peace we say that
the ground upon which we stand to-day is consecrated
and distinguished by the valour of our
soldier hero, who gave up his life on this spot in
the first great battle of the War of 1812 to purchase
that peace which a grateful country has ever since
enjoyed.</p>

<h6>ANGUS CLAUDE MACDONELL, ESQ., K.C., M.P., ADDRESSING THE GATHERING.</h6>

<p>This monument under which we stand is a fit
emblem of everlasting peace and at the same time
it fittingly commemorates the glorious death of the
man in memory of whom it was raised. We Canadians
should ever be grateful to Divine Providence
for having favoured us with such an able civil and
military chief, because Brock was both the chief
executive in our civil affairs and Commander-in-Chief
of the forces. As Administrator of the
Province of Upper Canada he was able and prudent;
as Commander-in-Chief he was experienced
and fearless. It remained, however, for the great
chief Tecumseh to read the true character of the
man as man. When they first met, Tecumseh
turned to his fellow chiefs and allies, and, pointing
to Brock, who stood by him, said, "This is a man!"
The correctness of this opinion was borne out in
both the life and death of Brock.</p>

<p>Our hero was ever dutiful. He always performed
his duty and saw that others did likewise. The
performance of duty was ever uppermost in his
mind, and his ideals were always high, his aspirations
noble. Permit me to quote here one of his
first General Orders issued to the troops immediately
upon his taking the field on the 4th of
July, 1812:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Major-General calls the serious attention
of every militiaman to the efforts making by the
enemy to destroy and lay waste this flourishing
country; they must be sensible of the great stake
they have to contend for and will, by their conduct,
convince the enemy that they are not desirous of
bowing their necks to a foreign yoke. The Major-General
is determined to devote his best energies
to the defence of the country, and has no doubt
that, supported by the zeal, activity and determination
of the loyal inhabitants of this Province, he
will successfully repel every hostile attack, and
preserve to them inviolate all that they hold dear."</p></div>

<p>The result of the war proves how well Brock
himself lived up to these sentiments.</p>

<p>Let us always remember that the War of 1812
was not of our making. On the 18th of June, 1812,
President Madison declared war against Great
Britain, with Canada as the point of attack. The
"Right of Search," the power to search for contraband
or for deserters on board of American ships,
was claimed by Britain, but was resisted by the
United States. Strange to say, this claim was
abandoned by Great Britain the very day before
war was declared by President Madison, yet the
war was declared and went on. It will be readily
seen that Canada had absolutely nothing to do
with this war or its alleged cause, the "Right of
Search"; and yet, in making this war on Canada,
the United States placed itself on record as approving
a forcible invasion of a neighbouring peaceful
country and of involving it in all the horrors of
war. At that time the United States had eight
million people, Upper Canada had barely eighty
thousand. At the very outset the Americans placed
upon a war footing one hundred and seventy-five
thousand men, whereas there were less than ten
thousand men of all kinds capable of bearing arms
in Upper Canada. These figures give us an idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
of the very great disparity both in numbers and
fighting strength between the two peoples so far
as we in Upper Canada were concerned. During
the two and a half years of the war there were no
less than twelve separate and distinct invasions of
Canada, and fifty-six military and naval engagements,
the great majority of which were won by
our forces. While Brock lived his genius and spirit
guided and inspired the defence of the country, and
after his death his noble example and the preparations
he had made for war during his life encouraged
and enabled the people to repel the invader.</p>

<p>Under the guise of strict discipline and the grim
visage of a soldier and fighting man, Isaac Brock
possessed a warm human heart; he was ever solicitous
for the comfort and well-being of his people
and especially of his militia soldiers, and on every
occasion consistent with the safety of the Province
he relaxed the rigours of war and would permit the
militia to return to their homes and farms. This
is evidenced by many of his Militia General Orders.
An extract from Militia General Orders of 26th of
August, 1812, immediately after the capture of
Detroit, reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Major-General Brock has ever felt anxious to
study the comforts and conveniences of the militia,
but the conduct of the detachments which lately
accompanied him to Detroit has if possible
increased his anxiety on this subject. The present
cessation of hostilities enables him to dispense
with the services of a large proportion of them for
a short period."</p></div>

<p>We very naturally ask ourselves who these troops
were for whose welfare General Brock was always
so solicitous. There were of course some British
regular troops in Canada, noticeably the Forty-ninth,
Brock's own regiment, but during the earlier
stages of the war, and while Brock lived, the men
of the Province, militia and yeomanry, had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
relied upon mainly; these chiefly were the men of
the York, Glengarry, Norfolk and other militia
regiments; every loyal man capable of bearing arms
in the Province turned out to fight, or to help those
who fought. The York and Glengarry militia
served with great distinction, and I may perhaps
be permitted to refer to the fact that forty-three
gentlemen of my own name and family connection
held commissions in the various regiments in that
war. In connection with this I might further mention
a somewhat curious incident. My own grandfather,
Colonel Alexander Macdonell, was taken
prisoner by the Americans at the Battle of
Niagara, and was confined as a prisoner at Lancaster,
Pennsylvania, in the very same prison in
which his own father, Captain Allan Macdonell,
had been confined by the Revolutionary States as
a prisoner of war during the Revolutionary War,
1776-83.</p>

<p>Now, happily, all is peace; we have enjoyed one
hundred years of peace and we thank Divine Providence
for it. We have had preserved to us by
Brock and those who fought and fell with him a
rich kingdom; we possess it in peace and happiness
and great prosperity. This is an age of peace, and
in this age and generation it is fit that we should
advance all the works and arts of peace; a very
great trust in this respect has been handed down
to us and confided to our safe keeping. In these
days of our prosperity we must protect and defend
and develop this great country, this rich heritage
which the heroism of our forefathers has preserved
to us. We must not only conserve it, but we must
better it and develop it, and make useful to man
all these possessions which have been given us.
Our ideals and ambitions must always be high, and
if we find ourselves faltering let us look upon this
splendid monument and think of the hero in
honour of whom it was raised; and let us at all
times remember that now as in 1812 in unity we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
possess our strength; we must become one people
if we are to be a great people, with one great common
country. We have many Provinces but only
one Canada.</p>

<p>It has been well said by one of Brock's
biographers that "it remains for the youth of
Canada to profoundly cherish the memory of Isaac
Brock and to never lose an opportunity to follow
the example set for them by his splendid deeds."
It has also been truly said that "he fell ere he saw
the star of his country rise," and, although the sky
over this battlefield upon which his eyes closed
forever one hundred years ago was cloudy and
overcast, yet because he lived and died those who
came after him enjoy the cloudless sunshine of
peace and happiness.</p>

<p>Brock's family motto was "He who guards never
sleeps." We know how faithfully he guarded and
safeguarded his country in life, and let us pray
that in death under this monument he sleeps well.</p>

<h3>HON. DR. R. A. PYNE<br />

<small>Minister of Education, Ontario</small></h3>

<p>I have a great deal of pleasure in being present
here to-day on this historic spot, and am deeply
sensible of the honour conferred upon me in asking
me to represent the Government of Ontario on this
occasion.</p>

<p>We are meeting here to-day to commemorate the
deeds of a great man who passed away in his effort
to save this part of the world for the British
Empire. We must remember that at the time of
the battle this part of the world was a wilderness,
and Sir Isaac Brock's wonderful capabilities
enabled him to consolidate the people of this
sparsely settled country, not forgetting our dear
old friends the Indians. With a handful of people,
as compared with the country to the south of us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
he made a gallant defence, and, as I said, retained
this part of the world for the British Empire. He
was not only a great soldier, but a diplomat and a
statesman, and whatever his vision may have been
one hundred years ago, everyone will agree with
me that it was of such a character that he retained
one of the best and finest parts of the world for
Great Britain.</p>

<p>Let me say a word regarding the loyalty, the love
of home and patriotism that existed at that time
on this field of battle, and it might be asked, what
are we doing to-day to create a sentiment of patriotism
and loyalty to our country and flag? Let me
contrast the efforts made in Canada to create a
patriotic and national sentiment as compared with
the country to the south of us. Just here let me
tell you a short story regarding what occurred to
myself in the city of Detroit some years ago, before
I was a member of the Legislative Assembly or had
any thought of public life. I have always remembered
it with the keenest appreciation of the great
work in which the people to the south of us are
engaged, inculcating in the youth of the country a
loyal and patriotic sentiment. I was in Detroit on
a school <i>f&#234;te</i> day when the children of each school
were marshalled together for a march past the
Detroit City Hall, where they had a large picture
of the President surrounded by their national flag,
the Stars and Stripes. As each school reached the
entrance to the City Hall the scholars halted,
saluted, and gave three cheers. To a little urchin
on the street near me who was selling papers I
said, "Why do they stop and cheer?" He replied,
"They are cheering for the old flag which we call
'Old Glory,' and, sir, let me tell you that is the flag
that was never licked!" I possibly did not agree
with the accuracy of his history, but I realized the
sentiment that had been created in that youngster's
mind, a sentiment of loyalty and patriotism no
doubt inculcated in his mind at school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>You may reasonably ask, "What are we doing to
create a sentiment of loyalty and patriotism in this
country?" and I may say that we have succeeded in
placing the Union Jack, the flag of civilization, over
every rural school in the Province of Ontario. I
am also reminded of what took place the other day
in the State of New Jersey, and as you are a reading
people, this episode would not pass unnoticed by
you&mdash;it appeared in all of the papers of last week.
A boy attending a high school in the State of New
Jersey was asked, as is their custom Monday morning,
to salute the flag and to announce allegiance to
the United States. The boy stated that he had no
objection to salute the flag, but he could not give
his allegiance to the United States as he was a
British subject. Mr. President, I find that the State
regulations of New Jersey call upon every scholar
in their schools to salute the flag on each Monday
morning and to declare their allegiance to the
United States. This boy, being a British subject,
could not conform to that part of the regulations,
and was dismissed from the school. What would
our people think of a regulation of that kind? I
leave it for your meditation.</p>

<p>I hope and trust this meeting will be an inspiration
that will extend all over this Dominion of Canada,
and that some definite and proper way shall
be found to commemorate the deeds of our ancestors
and those great heroes whose efforts we to-day jubilate
in this part of Canada, realizing the great
heritage that has become ours through the agency
of those great men who have passed away. May
Canada always remain a part&mdash;and by the
Almighty's help I believe it will always remain a
part&mdash;of the British Empire.</p>

<p>Mr. President, let me congratulate the Historical
Societies, the volunteers and cadets here assembled
for bringing about this wonderful meeting, which
I trust will have an influence in making this an
annual celebration for all time to come.</p>

<h3>COLONEL GEORGE T. DENISON<br />

<small>Toronto</small></h3>

<p>It is a great satisfaction to me to be here to-day
and to know that so many patriotic societies and
organizations have clubbed together to commemorate
so splendidly the one hundredth anniversary
of the notable victory gained upon this field.</p>

<p>The great, virile nations of the world have always
commemorated the brave deeds and victories of
their fathers. The Romans did everything in their
power to inspire their young men with love of
country by relating stories of their glorious past.
Some of them were evidently legends, but they all
tended to create and instil a pure national spirit.</p>

<p>For five hundred years after Marathon the
Athenians commemorated the glorious victory won
against overwhelming odds. The Spartans never
forgot the death of Leonidas and his three hundred
brave, unflinching followers, who died for the
honour of their country at Thermopyl&#230;. Pausanias
the historian was able to read six hundred years
after upon a column erected to their memory in
Sparta, the names of the three hundred Spartans
who had died with their king in that fight.</p>

<p>In Russia also the same spirit of reverence for
their great heroes has always shown itself. Dimitry
saved Russia by a great victory over the Tartars
in 1380. Over five hundred years have elapsed,
but still the name of Dimitry Donskoi lives in the
memory and the songs of the Russian people, and
still on "Dimitry's Saturday," the anniversary of
the battle, prayers are offered up in memory of the
brave men who fell on that day in defence of their
country.</p>

<p>Switzerland is another example of the patriotism
of a free people. They won their freedom by
three great victories won against overwhelming
odds at Morgarten, Sempach and Naefels. Naefels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
was the final victory, and every year the people
commemorate the great event. In solemn procession
the people revisit the battlefield and the Landamman
tells the fine old story of their deliverance
from foreign rule. The five hundredth anniversary
was celebrated in 1888, and people from
all parts of Switzerland flocked to participate in
the patriotic and religious services. This national
spirit has kept Switzerland free although surrounded
by great powers. Her children are all
trained as soldiers in their public schools, and compulsory
training of all their youth is rigidly
enforced. We could learn a lesson from them in
this.</p>

<p>Canada has shown the same virile spirit as other
great nations, and we may take pride in the way in
which our people have recognized what they owe
to General Brock and the men who fought with
him on this field one hundred years ago. This spot
has seen several inspiring demonstrations.</p>

<p>Brock and Macdonell had been buried in Fort
George in 1812. In 1824 their remains were
removed and buried again under the first monument
here. In 1824 there were no railways, practically
no steamers, and the population of the Province
was very small, and yet in the funeral cortege
there were 560 men on horseback, 285 carriages
and wagons, and thousands of persons on foot, in
all estimated at about ten thousand people, who
followed the remains the seven miles from Niagara
to this place. That was a remarkable tribute to
the memory of the great general.</p>

<p>In 1840 the monument was blown up on Good
Friday by an Irish rebel or Fenian named Benjamin
Lett. This aroused intense indignation
throughout the Province, and a great demonstration
was organized to arrange for building a new
monument on a grander scale. The meeting was
held in July, 1840, and a great number of the foremost
men in public life attended. Ten steamers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
all crowded with people, moved up the river in
procession. About eight thousand persons were
present. A new monument was decided upon and
it is here above us now. It is a wonderful monument
to have been erected by a small community
when there was very little wealth in the country.
This monument is as a column the finest and grandest
I have seen. I put it far above the column to
Alexander I. in front of the Winter Palace in
St. Petersburg. It is about forty feet higher than
the one to Nelson in Trafalgar Square. The
National German Monument in the Neiderwald
does not strike me as being so impressive.</p>

<p>In 1859, on the anniversary of the battle, there
was another great gathering here for the inauguration
of the monument. I was here with a detachment
of my corps and there were a great many
other detachments and people, and about two hundred
of the old veterans of the war who came again
to do honour to their dead chief. In the following
year the late King was visiting Canada, and
naturally he came here to do honour to the memory
of the great general and to meet the surviving
veterans of the war. There was another great
demonstration and I was there on that occasion
also. Could anything show more clearly the deep
hold that General Brock had on the affection
and memory of the Canadian people than these
repeated gatherings? And now, after another fifty-two
years, there is this splendid demonstration of
respect and gratitude. I am proud that our people
have done their duty to-day, and I hope that our
action will inspire our children a hundred years
hence to commemorate the great event. I make no
apologies for coming here to glory over the victory.
Brock died on this field and our fathers fought here
that we should be a free and independent people,
and we have enjoyed that position for a hundred
years, thanks to their efforts. How can we use that
freedom better, than in testifying in the heartiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
manner our gratitude and appreciation for the
priceless boon which we owe to those who then
won it for us!</p>

<h3>MR. J. A. MACDONELL, K.C.<br />

<small>Glengarry, Ontario</small></h3>

<p>Permit me to express on behalf of the members of
this generation of the family to which the former
Attorney-General Macdonell belonged, my warm
appreciation of the honour which was done to that
gentleman's memory, by the invitation which in
terms so generous and complimentary and so
appreciative of his services, was extended to me as
the representative of his family, to be present on
this most interesting occasion as the special guest
of your Committee.</p>

<p>We are assembled here to-day to commemorate
the Centennial Anniversary of the death of Sir
Isaac Brock, to give evidence that we Canadians
hold in grateful remembrance the inestimable services
which he rendered to our country, and to
record it as our firm and solemn conviction that
it is to that illustrious man of glorious memory
we owe the preservation of this country, our connection
with the Motherland and those British
institutions which it is our happiness now to enjoy.</p>

<p>It was indeed a privilege for any man to have
served under Sir Isaac Brock, to have been in any
way associated with him, and more especially to
have been placed in a position whereby he was
enabled to second his indomitable efforts. It was
the good fortune of Attorney-General Macdonell
to have been associated with him in a threefold
capacity. First he was connected with him by the
most intimate ties of private friendship, for there
existed between them the most perfect confidence
and a mutual regard, amounting, as is frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the case with men of generous impulse, to personal
affection. Then as Attorney-General of the
Province and chief law adviser of the Crown, he
was the trusted legal adviser of General Brock in
his capacity of President of the Council of the Province,
and although but a young man he was equal
to the exigencies of that critical period.</p>

<p>Upon the declaration of war, the House of
Assembly was hastily convened in extra session
on the 27th July, when General Brock, in the
Speech from the Throne, made use of those ever-memorable
words: "We are engaged in an awful
and eventful contest. By unanimity and despatch
in our councils and by vigour in our operations
we will teach the enemy this lesson: that a country
defended by free men, enthusiastically devoted to
the cause of their King and Constitution, can
never be conquered." But the House proved recalcitrant,
and refused to comply with Brock's request
to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act. It was the
Attorney-General who solved the difficulty by giving
it as his legal opinion that Major-General
Brock, as Administrator of the Province, under
the authority of his Commission from the King,
had the power to dissolve the House and proclaim
martial law, and that under the circumstances it
was his duty to do so. This opinion was concurred
in by his colleagues in the Government, and,
accordingly, the Government as such tendered it
as their unanimous advice to the Administrator,
who immediately acted upon it, and thereby saved
the country.</p>

<p>As a consequence of this drastic measure, the
three leaders of the Opposition in the Legislature&mdash;Joseph
Willcocks, Benjamin Mallory and Abraham
Markle&mdash;who had been chiefly instrumental
up to this time in thwarting all Brock's efforts,
immediately fled to the United States, with which
they had long been in traitorous intercourse, and
where all their sympathies lay, Willcocks being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
eventually killed at the battle of Fort Erie, in 1814,
in command of an American regiment, and Mallory
serving throughout the war as a major in the same
corps.</p>

<p>This measure enabled Brock also to deal summarily
with their disloyal partisans and followers,
much more numerous and infinitely more dangerous
than is now generally supposed. He immediately
issued a proclamation ordering all persons
suspected of conniving with the enemy to be apprehended,
and treated according to law. Those who
had not taken the oath of allegiance were ordered
to do so or leave the Province; many were sent out
of the country; large numbers left of their own
accord; those who refused to take the oath or to
take up arms to defend the country, and remained
in the Province after a given date, were declared
to be enemies and spies, and were treated accordingly;
a large number of this disloyal element were
arrested and imprisoned early in the war, as on the
day of the Battle of Queenston Heights the jail
and Court House at Niagara as well as the blockhouse
at Fort George were filled with political
prisoners, over three hundred aliens and traitors
being in custody, some of whom were tried and
sentenced to death, while others were sent to
Quebec for imprisonment.</p>

<p>This pressing and important business having
been accomplished, General Brock entered actively
upon his campaign, and determined upon offensive
measures by an assault upon Detroit. Colonel
Macdonell accompanied him as his military secretary
and aide-de-camp. When the American, General
Hull, in command of a greatly superior force
and in possession of a strongly fortified position,
on the 16th August proposed a cessation of hostilities
with a view to his surrender, it was Colonel
Macdonell whom General Brock entrusted with
the delicate and important task of preparing the
terms of capitulation. He returned within an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
with the conditions, which were immediately confirmed
by General Brock, whereby Fort Detroit
with 59,700 square miles of American territory&mdash;the
whole State of Michigan&mdash;was surrendered.
2,500 officers and men became prisoners of war,
and 2,500 stand of arms, thirty-three pieces of
cannon, the <i>Adams</i> brig-of-war, and stores and
munitions of war to the value of &#163;40,000, all so
sorely needed by the Canadian militia, were handed
over to the British Commander.</p>

<p>General Brock in his despatch to the Home Government
announcing the capture of Detroit, and
which was published in a Gazette Extraordinary
in London on the 6th October, with characteristic
generosity bore testimony to the services of his
friend in the following terms: "In the attainment
of this important point gentlemen of the first character
and influence showed an example highly
creditable to them, and I cannot on this occasion
avoid mentioning the essential assistance I derived
from John Macdonell, Esquire, His Majesty's
Attorney-General, who from the beginning of the
war has honoured me with his services as my Provincial
Aide-de-Camp."</p>

<p>Brock's biographer and nephew, Mr. Ferdinand
Brock Tupper, graphically tells the end of them
both, almost upon the spot upon which we now
stand. After mention of the hasty gallop from
Fort George, at dawn on the 13th October, when
it was found that the Americans had during the
night passed over the Niagara River and succeeded
in gaining the crest of the heights in rear of the
battery, and Brock's desperate effort to dislodge
them, he goes on to say: "The Americans now
opened a heavy fire of musketry, and, conspicuous
from his dress, his height, and the enthusiasm with
which he animated his little band, the British commander
was soon singled out, and he fell about
an hour after his arrival, the fatal bullet entering
his right breast and passing through his left side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
He lived only long enough to request that his fall
might not be noticed, or prevent the advance of his
brave troops. The lifeless body was immediately
conveyed into a house at Queenston, where it
remained until the afternoon, unperceived of the
enemy. His aide-de-camp, Lieutenant-Colonel Macdonell,
Attorney-General of Upper Canada&mdash;a fine,
promising young man&mdash;was mortally wounded soon
after his chief, and died the next day, at the early
age of twenty-seven years. Although one bullet had
passed through his body, and he was wounded in
four places, yet he survived twenty hours, and
during a period of excruciating agony his thoughts
and words were constantly occupied in lamentations
for his deceased commander and friend. He
fell while gallantly charging, with the hereditary
courage of his race, up the hill with 190 men,
chiefly of the York Volunteers, by which charge
the enemy was compelled to spike the eighteen-pounders
in the battery there; and his memory will
be cherished as long as courage and devotion are
reverenced in the Province."</p>

<p>General Sheaffe, who succeeded General Brock
upon the death of the latter, in his despatch
announcing the victory which eventually crowned
our arms, thus couples their names: " .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No
officer was killed besides Major-General Brock, one
of the most gallant and zealous officers in His Majesty's
service, whose loss cannot be too much
deplored, and Lieutenant-Colonel Macdonell, Provincial
Aide-de-Camp, whose gallantry and merit
rendered him worthy of his chief."</p>

<p>The Prince Regent thus acknowledged the
communication through the Governor-General, by
whom it had been forwarded: "His Royal Highness,
the Prince Regent, is fully aware of the severe
loss which His Majesty's service has experienced
in the death of Major-General Sir Isaac Brock.
This would have been sufficient to have clouded a
victory of much greater importance. His Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
has lost in him not only an able and meritorious
officer, but one who, in the exercise of his functions
of Provisional Lieutenant-Governor of the Province,
displayed qualities admirably adapted to
awe the disloyal, to reconcile the wavering, and to
animate the great mass of the inhabitants against
successive attempts of the enemy to invade the Province,
in the last of which he unhappily fell, too
prodigal of that life of which his eminent services
had taught us to understand the value. His Royal
Highness has also been pleased to express his
regret at the loss which the Province must experience
in the death of the Attorney-General, Mr.
Macdonell, whose zealous co-operation with Sir
Isaac Brock will reflect lasting honour on his
memory." In communicating the above to the
father of the Attorney-General, Lieutenant-Colonel
Coffin, P.A.D.C., under date York, March 20th,
1813, stated by command of His Honour the President
that "it would doubtless afford some satisfaction
to all the members of the family to which
the late Attorney-General was so great an ornament
to learn that his merit has been recognized
even by the Royal Personage who wields the sceptre
of the British Empire, and on which His Honour
commands me to declare his personal gratification."</p>

<p>No medal was struck for Queenston Heights, but
when some time afterwards the rewards for the
capture of Detroit were distributed, gold medals
were deposited by the Sovereign with the families
of Major-General Brock and Colonel Macdonell,
and the King stated in each instance that it was
done "in token of the respect which His Majesty
entertains for the memory of that officer."</p>

<p>The graciously worded despatch of the Prince
Regent mentioned the only fault of Sir Isaac
Brock. Like Nelson he was too prodigal of his
life; but as, alike by his services and his glorious
death, Nelson became the hero and the idol of the
British people, so by his services and his death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Brock became for all time the hero of the people
of this Province, and his memory will never die.
Although he had served ten years in Canada, he
had held his position as Administrator of Upper
Canada but a few days over a year; yet that
short time was sufficient to obtain for his name
immortality, so long as the English language can
narrate what in that brief period he accomplished,
and hold forth for succeeding generations of
British subjects in Canada and throughout the
Empire the bright example of his genius and his
gallantry, and the indomitable spirit with which
he contended and overcame difficulties, apparently
insurmountable, and which were sufficient to appal
a heart even as stout and to tax to the uttermost a
mind as versatile and resourceful as his.</p>

<p>Under this stately column he found a fitting
tomb, and the ardent young friend, Glengarry's
representative, who fell with him, lies beside him.</p>

<h3>DR. JAMES L. HUGHES<br />

<small>Chief Inspector of Schools, Toronto</small></h3>

<p>I had the honour of requesting the Hon. Dr.
Pyne, Minister of Education, to call the attention
of the School Boards of Ontario to the
importance of celebrating the hundredth anniversary
of the victory so gallantly won on these
heights, and of paying due tribute to the
brave men and women who so nobly and
heroically struggled to preserve for us the blessings
of British liberty, and of unity with our
motherland. To these men and women of firm
faith and strong heart we give gratitude and reverence
to-day, and especially to the statesman and
hero who at the foot of these heights died a hundred
years ago while leading Canadian volunteers
to drive back invaders who without just cause had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
dared to come to Canada with the avowed purpose
of forcibly taking possession of our country.</p>

<p>In the judgment of the committee that arranged
for the celebration of the glorious deeds of our
early history, it is most important that Canadian
children should be trained to revere the memories
of the great and true men and women of one hundred
years ago, and to rejoice because of the victories
won by them for freedom and for imperial
unity.</p>

<p>There are men who have written to the newspapers
objecting to the course we adopted. They
seem to think it improper to let our children know
that our country was ever in danger, and that it
was saved by the unselfish devotion and the brave
deeds of our ancestors. However, in spite of their
protests, based on weak and unpatriotic sentiment,
we intend to teach young Canadians to remember
the patriotism and valour of the founders and
defenders of Canada, and to train them to become
worthy successors to the men and women who made
such sacrifices for them.</p>

<p>We have no wish to fill the hearts of the pupils
in our schools with animosity towards the great
nation whose fertile fields and happy homes we see
beyond the great river that separates it from our
own fair land. We wish to develop in our children
a spirit that will lead them to say to the people
across our borderland not "Hands off Canada,"
but "Hands together to achieve for God and for
humanity the highest and broadest and truest
ideals that have been revealed to the Anglo-Saxon
race."</p>

<p>We do not wish to make our children quarrelsome
or offensive, but we do wish them to be
patriotic Canadians, full of loyalty to their flag,
their Empire, and their King. We wish them to
understand what their predecessors did in order
that they may have faith in themselves and in their
country; and we intend that they shall learn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
achievements of the past in order that they may
have a true basis for their own manhood and
womanhood. True reverence for courage and self-sacrifice,
fidelity to principle, and devotion to home
and country in time of need, is a fundamental element
of strong, true character. The facts of history
may have little influence in developing character,
but the noble deeds of our ancestors performed
for high purposes are the surest sources for
the development of the strong and true emotions
that make human character vital instead of inert.
Emotions form the battery power of character, and
among the emotions that give strength and virility
and beauty to character, reverence for the dead
who wisely struggled and nobly achieved, is surely
one of the most productive of dignified and transforming
character.</p>

<p>The history of the past is valuable chiefly for the
opportunities it gives to be stirred to deep, true
enthusiasm for heroism, for honour, for patriotism,
for love of freedom, for devotion to duty, and for
sublime self-sacrifice for high ideals. Whatever
else we may neglect in the training of the young, I
trust we shall never fail to fill their hearts with
profound reverence for the men and women of the
past to whom they owe so much.</p>

<p>We should teach other lessons from the War of
1812. We should fill each child's life with a splendid
courage that can never be dismayed, by telling
how a few determined settlers scattered widely
over a new country successfully repelled invading
armies coming from a country with a population
twenty-fold larger. We should teach reverence
not only for manhood but for womanhood by
recounting the terrible hardships endured willingly
by Canadian women generally, as well as by
proudly relating the noble work done by individual
women, of whom Laura Secord was so conspicuous
an example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>A certain class of thoughtless people call us
"flag-wavers" if we strive to give our young people
a true conception of the value of national life, and
of their duty to have a true love for their country
and for their Empire. If a flag-waver means one
who is proud of a noble ancestry, and determined
to prove worthy of the race from which he sprung;
one who knows that his forefathers gave a wider
meaning to freedom, and who intends to perpetuate
liberty and aid in giving it a still broader and
higher value; one who is grateful because his
Empire represents the grandest revelation of unity
yet made known to humanity and who accepts this
revelation as a sacred trust, then I am a flag-waver,
and I shall make every boy and girl whom I can
ever influence a flag-waver who loves his flag and
waves it because it represents freedom, and honour,
and justice, and truth, and unity, and a glorious
history, the most triumphantly progressive that
has been achieved by any nation in the development
of the world.</p>

<p>We do well to celebrate the great deeds of the
men and women of a hundred years ago, and teach
our children to give them reverence, but it is far
more important for us to consider what the people
a hundred years hence will think of us than to
glorify the triumphs of a hundred years ago. The
work of the world is not done. Evolution to higher
ideals goes ever on. Each succeeding generation
has greater responsibilities and higher duties than
the one that preceded it. The greatest lesson we
can learn from the past is that we should prove
true to the opportunities of our time; that we
should with unselfish motive and undaunted hearts
accept the responsibilities that come to us as partners
in our magnificent Empire, and share in the
achievement of greater triumphs for freedom and
justice than have ever been recorded in the past.</p>

<p>Inspired by the records of such men as Brock,
at the foot of whose monument we stand to-day and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
look with reminiscent glance over the marvellous
progress of a hundred glorious years, let us determine
that we shall do our part to make the coming
century more fruitful than the past.</p>

<h3>CHIEF A. G. SMITH<br />

<small>Six Nation Indians, Grand River Reserve</small></h3>

<p>If a Mohawk Chief had in his make-up a particle
of timidity I fear that your cheering would have
frightened or disconcerted me.</p>

<p>Now, contrary to the usual preface to speeches
on occasions of this nature, let me instead say that
my pleasure in addressing you this afternoon is
not altogether unalloyed, as I look back to the
remote past, when my ancestors could make or
unmake nations on this continent; their favour was
then courted by the different European nations,
until finally they entered into an alliance or treaty
with the military authorities of the British nation,
and which the Six Nations has ever held inviolate.</p>

<p>They, however, in my humble opinion, made a
serious mistake in taking sides in the War of
American Independence, as their treaty obligations
only required them to assist the British when
attacked by a foreign power and not in a case of
family quarrel, so they could have consistently
taken a neutral ground. It is not, however, so
surprising that they took the step they did when
we consider the influences that were brought to
bear on them and the inducements that were held
out to them. Consider the influence of Tha-yen-da-ne-gea&mdash;Brant,
their war chief&mdash;and their own
love of war. War with them was as religion. Add
to these the influence of Sir William Johnson and
others.</p>

<p>And there was the very strong inducement that
they would be guaranteed a perpetual independence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and self-government, and also that they would
be amply indemnified for any and all losses that
they might sustain by their services. Now we
know that these pledges were not adequately fulfilled,
yet, notwithstanding this fact, the Six
Nations remained faithful in their adherence to
the British Crown.</p>

<p>And now allow me to come down to the eventful
times which more immediately concern us this
afternoon. Let me at the outset briefly but most
emphatically assert that in those troublous times
no followers of the illustrious Brock, whose fall and
victory we are this afternoon commemorating,
fought more bravely than the Six Nations; their
very admiration of that great and brave general
was as a spur to their bravery.</p>

<p>I think I may truthfully say that had it not been
for the bravery of the Six Nations the Union Jack
would not to-day be waving over these historic
heights.</p>

<p>The Six Nations have never had an historian of
their own to record the brave deeds of valour of
their warriors, and therefore get but scant justice
in the historical records of this country; naturally
the historians magnify the achievements of their
own peoples, while I claim that more credit should
be given my own people.</p>

<p>Let me instance one or two samples of justice
doled out to my people in various lines. You know
that in Ontario manhood suffrage prevails in political
elections, so that any foreigner after six
months' residence can have every privilege of a
full citizen, although he may have no higher interest
in the country than as a place in which to earn
his bread and butter, and whose ancestors have
never shed a drop of blood for its retention by
Britain, and who himself may never fight in its
defence, but who may go back to fight his own
country's battles, perhaps even against Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>But the original owners of this country, proved
to be men on many a battlefield, who fought and
won Britain's battles, ceased to be men and became
minors after the battles were won and British predominance
secured, and therefore are not allowed
men's privileges.</p>

<p>I contend that if Canada is to do justice (and I
believe it will) to the Six Nations, it will have to
give them representation on the floor of the House
of Commons and also respect the treaty concessions
made to them, instead of gradually curtailing
their tribal rights and privileges. These blood-bought
rights and privileges are just as dear to the
Six Nations as similar ones are to any other nation.</p>

<p>I fear, Mr. Chairman, that I have already taken
up my allotted time, so will refrain from giving all
the examples of our loyalty I would have liked to
present to this vast assemblage. Allow me, however,
to say that as this is an influential gathering,
so I hope that each individual of influence will go
back to his or her sphere of usefulness and listen
to the cry for justice on behalf of the Six Nations,
fully appreciating the fact that it is "up to you"
to see to it that justice is done this people who have
rendered such inestimable service to this country
and to Britain.</p>

<p>My remarks may not suit everyone, but I cannot
help that. I am not courting popularity, for I am
getting too old for that, and I am descended from
too long a line of brave warriors to be afraid to
speak the truth, whether it be pleasant or otherwise.</p>

<p>Thanking you, Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen,
for the privilege and honour of addressing
this influential assemblage and for the kind hearing
and attention accorded to me.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>[At the conclusion of Chief Smith's speech three
rousing warwhoops were given, led by Chiefs Johnson
and Elliott, and joined in by all present.]</p>

<h3>WARRIOR F. ONONDEYOH LOFT<br />

<small>Six Nation Indians</small></h3>

<p>We are assembled to-day on this historic spot to
commemorate the memory of a great soldier, a
patriot and renowned son of the Empire of which
we are a part.</p>

<p>I am pleased to note the presence of so many
chiefs and warriors of the Six Nations who are
here assembled on the basis of one common citizenship
with you, to join with our white brethren to
pay respect and homage to the late hero, General
Sir Isaac Brock, who offered his life as a sacrifice
in the cause he so gallantly defended. He was the
brave leader who led the white man and Indian in
the defence of our country, our flag, and all that
pertained to the maintenance of British institutions.</p>

<p>Our act to-day is a noble one. It is of a kind that
touches deep down into the heart that throbs with
affection's glow. It is one worthy of emulation
by our posterity. We as a people should never lose
sight of the great importance that must attach to
this occasion, and of the duty we owe to our children
to do all we can to impress their minds with
the precepts of loyalty to the king and crown, that
should be ever steadfast and immovable.</p>

<p>As a member of the Six Nations it is not altogether
my wish that I should be looked upon on
this occasion as a mere representative of my
nation, but rather as a representative of the noble
native Indian race which has so conspicuously
identified itself with British arms at critical
periods in the history of our fair Dominion.</p>

<p>One hundred years ago our country and people
were befogged by conditions that were grey and
ominous. It was very uncertain as to the part, if
any, the Indians would take in the impending conflict.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>From this spot, almost, General Brock set out
for Amherstburg to arrange plans of campaign,
and there met and shook hands with Tecumseh,
this patriot Indian giving the assurance to his
chief in command of the forces that he and his
united Indian tribes composed of the Shawanoes,
Wyandottes, Chippewas, Ottawas, Foxes and
others, were ready to go into the field of action in
defence of the British cause.</p>

<p>Like General Brock, this noble red man, as a
leader of his kinsmen, also sacrificed his life in
the cause of his king and country. And sad is it
to say that not even a heave of the turf marks his
last resting-place.</p>

<p>It is not for me to laud or unduly magnify the
important part the Indians have played in wars
that have marked our country's history-making:
but should such an emergency again present
itself, I feel confident that the Indians will never
be found wanting.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><a name="McCullough" id="McCullough"></a></p>
<h3>MR. CHARLES R. McCULLOUGH<br />

<small>Honorary President of the Association of Canadian Clubs</small></h3>

<p>I tender my thanks to the Committee for honouring
the hundred clubs of the Dominion by inviting
their honorary president to take part in the proceedings
of this great day.</p>

<p>The real celebration of the centenary of the
battle and the fitting remembrance of the hero who
gave up his life for Canada one hundred years ago,
has already taken place in the six thousand schools
by six hundred thousand scholars of this premier
Province of Ontario. By this vast army of patriots
in the making there has been celebrated within the
past few days in song and story the splendid heroism
of the immortal Brock, and the work done by
him for our common country a century ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>In that great work he was nobly seconded by the
brilliant young Glengarrian Macdonell, who, like
his illustrious leader, fell on the slope of this
sacred hill.</p>

<p>In this dread contest there fought side by side
regular soldier and militiaman; the noble red man
and the freed black man contended against a common
enemy to that freedom and that constitution
that every Briton loves so well.</p>

<p>It was indeed a proud thing for Canadians to
remember that whilst there was a great Imperial
officer to lead the little band, close beside him in
the great struggle there ever stood a valorous
Canadian aide-de-camp. Yes, for every regular
that contended for the maintenance of British law
and authority in this Canada of ours there were
fighting by his side the farmer and the tradesman
of those heroic days.</p>

<p>Was not this prophetic of that future co-operation
between mother and daughter states? Was it
not full of the deepest meaning for us of the twentieth
century? Could we not say "Thy people are
my people and my people thy people"? As in the
days of yore, so in these days of Canada's abounding
prosperity and increasing national greatness,
there would be found men and means for any
national or Imperial emergency that the future
might have in store for us.</p>

<p>Our magnificently proportioned Canada must
have a magnificently proportioned soul if she
would fulfil her high destiny of eventual leadership
in the band of sister nations within an Empire
indissolubly bound by ties of love and sacrifice.
In enlarging the soul of our people such celebrations
as these have their sure and certain part, and
the thrill of Brock's great name will stir this
people's soul so long as Canada shall endure.</p>

<h3>HIGHLAND HEROES IN THE WAR OF<br />
1812-14<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br />

<small>By Dr. Alexander Fraser, Toronto</small></h3>


<p>While with a fine sense of fitness the part taken
by the men of Glengarry, Ontario, in the 1812-14
war is rarely referred to by the descendants of those
who fought so well and fell for their country, it is
but meet on a centennial occasion as is now being
celebrated that the distinguished services of the
clansmen should not be forgotten. Much, indeed,
could be said of the Macdonells, Macdonalds, Macleans,
MacMillans, Chisholms, Camerons and
Grants, as well as of other kindred families, who
displayed all the ardour of the Highland mountaineer
in defence of home and country, and who
occupied second place then nor subsequently when
the war-note sounded. These brief lines, however,
must deal only with Lieutenant-Colonel John Macdonell,
who fell mortally wounded at Queenston
Heights, and whose name cannot be disassociated
in history from that of Brock, the chief hero of the
war.</p>

<p>The many intermarriages in the course of generations
between members of different houses of the
Glengarry branch of Clan Donald have created
genealogical intricacies not always threaded by the
general reader. The identity of Colonel John Macdonell,
the Queenston hero, however, need never
have been in doubt. He was descended from Angus
Macdonell of Greenfield, a grandson of Ranald,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the ninth chief of Glengarry&mdash;in Gaelic, styled
"Mac-ic-Alasdair." The Macdonells of Greenfield
are nearer the main line of the Glengarry family
than the cadet branches of Aberchalder, Cullachie
and Leek&mdash;many of whom settled in Canada, who
left the parent stock at an earlier period. They
might reasonably be regarded as representative of
all the Glengarry Macdonells of Canada.</p>

<p>Angus Macdonell of Greenfield had one son, Alexander,
who came to Canada in 1792. He was married
in Scotland to a daughter of Alexander Macdonell
of Aberchalder (Captain 1st Battalion,
King's Royal Regiment of New York), and among
the issue of that marriage were Duncan, who succeeded
his father, John, who fell with Brock, and
Donald, who figured at Ogdensburg, 1813.</p>

<p>John Macdonell (Queenston) was born in 1785,
in Scotland, and with his family came to Canada
when seven years of age. In due course he became
member of the Legislature for Glengarry and Attorney-General
for Upper Canada. He was a Colonel
of Militia, and on the outbreak of the war of 1812
acted as Military Secretary and Provincial A.D.C.
to General Sir Isaac Brock. His legal talents were
regarded as of high order, and of his military abilities
Brock entertained a very good opinion indeed.
As President of the Council and Administrator of
Upper Canada, General Brock occupied the highest
civil position in the Province, and the chief military
position as General of the forces under his command.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel John Macdonell, as Attorney-General,
filled the next highest civil position to
Brock in Upper Canada, and, as Military Secretary
and P.A.D.C., was next highest in importance, if
not in rank, to his chief in the field. Testimony
was warmly borne by some of the most capable to
judge, of his dominance in the military operations,
and the subsequent negotiations, at Detroit, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
papers in connection therewith, which he is said to
have drafted, bear the mark of his patriotic and
generous mind. The Prince Regent, in expressing
his regret at the loss which the country must experience
by the death of the Attorney-General,
declared that "his zealous co-operation with Sir
Isaac Brock would reflect lasting honour on his
memory." Like Brock, he died unmarried; like
him, too, he was engaged to be married at the time
of his death. His fianc&#233;e was Miss Powell, daughter
of the Chief Justice.</p>

<p>The story is told that at the commencement of
the war, before making his will, Colonel Macdonell
told Miss Powell that, though he had only a little
estate to dispose of, about &#163;300 in money, his books,
papers and personal effects, together with ten acres
of land on Church Street, Toronto, he wished her
to have first choice of either the money and effects,
or the land, for herself; the other part to go to a
relative. She chose the money and the personalty,
and the ten acres of land on Church Street went
to his relative and godson, James Macdonell,
son of his host, the Hon. Alexander Macdonell,
Toronto, in whose family the title still remains.</p>

<p>Colonel Macdonell's father, Colonel Alexander
Macdonell, commanded the 2nd Battalion, Glengarry
Militia, in the war, and two of his brothers
also had commissions, Duncan Macdonell, as a Captain,
commanding a company at Ogdensburg
(under Colonel George Macdonell), and Donald
Greenfield Macdonell, who also commanded a company
at Ogdensburg. Duncan, the elder brother,
succeeded his father as Lieutenant-Colonel, commanding
the 2nd Battalion, Glengarry Militia,
until 1857, when he received the thanks of the Governor-General
"for his long and valuable services
dating from the last war." His son, Lieutenant-Colonel
Archibald J. Macdonell, was also commanding
officer of his grandfather's and father's regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
from 1857 to 1804. He was a barrister, and
a Bencher, and Recorder at Kingston, and for many
years a partner with Sir John A. Macdonald, Prime
Minister of Canada. His only son is the well-known
Lieut.-Col. John A. Macdonell, Alexandria,
Ontario, now the head of the Greenfield family,
whose patriotic sentiments and antiquarian tastes
have often found eloquent and useful expression.
He is a grandnephew of Colonel Macdonell (Queenston)
and fifth of Greenfield.</p>

<p>Donald Greenfield Macdonell, who commanded a
company at Ogdensburg (brother of Colonel Macdonell,
Queenston), became D.A.Q.M.G in the war,
was a Colonel of Militia and Deputy Adjutant-General
from 1846 to 1861. He had the honour of laying
the corner-stone of the monument to Sir Isaac
Brock at Queenston in 1853. Among his grandsons
are Donald Greenfield Macdonell, barrister,
Vancouver, heir male, after Lieut.-Col. John A. Macdonell,
Alexandria, Ontario, and A. McLean Macdonell,
K.C., the well-known barrister of Toronto.</p>

<p>The connection of Mr. A. McLean Macdonell,
K.C., of Toronto, with the War of 1812 is perhaps
unique. Not only had his paternal great-grandfather
and three sons, the Macdonells of Greenfield,
commissions in the War of 1812, as above stated, but
his maternal great-grandfather and three sons also
held commissions in that war, viz., the Honourable
Neil McLean and his three sons: 1st, the Honourable
Archibald McLean, afterwards Chief Justice
of Upper Canada. It is said that when Colonel
Macdonell fell, McLean was near him, and he called
out to him: "Help me, Archie." 2nd, John
McLean, afterwards Sheriff of Kingston; and 3rd,
Colonel Alexander McLean, who shows an excellent
military record, and whose daughter married John
Macdonell of Greenfield, Mr. McLean Macdonell's
father. Thus, Mr. McLean Macdonell had two
great-grandfathers, two grandfathers, and four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
granduncles, all holding important commissions in
the only war which has vitally threatened Canada.</p>

<p>The connection between A. Claude Macdonell,
M.P., Toronto, and Lieutenant-Colonel John Macdonell
(Queenston) is by intermarriage in the families
of Aberchalder and Cullachie. The Aberchalders
gave a father, Captain Alexander, and three
sons, John, Hugh, and Chichester, to the American
revolutionary war. John was a Captain in Butler's
Rangers and was the first Speaker of the first
House of Assembly of Upper Canada, in 1792.
Hugh was an officer in the King's Royal Regiment
and in the Royal Canadian Volunteer Regiment.
He was one of the members for Glengarry in the
first Legislature of Upper Canada. He afterwards
served at Gibraltar, and as British Consul-General
at Algiers. Chichester served in Butler's Rangers,
and became a colonel in the British army, winning
distinction at Corunna.</p>

<p>Allan Macdonell of Cullachie (closely related to
Aberchalder) was a captain in the 84th Royal
Highland Emigrant Regiment, and his son, Alexander,
an officer in Butler's Rangers, was prominent
in the military-political life of Upper Canada,
and at the time of the 1812 war was a colonel of
Militia and Deputy Postmaster-General. His son,
Angus Duncan Macdonell, who died in 1894, was
the father of Mr. Angus Claude Macdonell, M.P. for
South Toronto.</p>

<p>When Colonel Macdonell (Queenston) came to
Toronto as a young man in connection with his
profession, he resided with his relative, the Honourable
Alexander Macdonell, Mr. Claude Macdonell's
grandfather, and it was from his home he went to
the front. Needless to say, Colonel Macdonell's
memory is sacredly cherished among these and
many others of his kith and kin in Canada, as it is
indeed by all lovers of the heroic in Canadian
history.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">General Confession</span><br />

<small>(To be said by all, standing)</small></h4>

<p>Almighty and most merciful Father; We have
erred and strayed from Thy ways like lost sheep.
We have followed too much the devices and desires
of our own hearts. We have offended against Thy
Holy Laws. We have left undone the things which
we ought to have done; And we have done those
things which we ought not to have done; And there
is no health in us. But Thou, O Lord, have mercy
upon us, miserable offenders. Spare Thou them,
O God, which confess their faults. Restore Thou
them that are penitent; according to Thy promises
declared unto mankind in Christ Jesus our Lord.
And grant, O most merciful Father, for His sake,
that we may hereafter live a godly, righteous and
sober life, To the glory of Thy Holy Name. &nbsp; Amen.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Prayer for Pardon</span></h4>

<p>O Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, who desireth not the death of a sinner, but
rather that he may turn from his wickedness, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
live, pardon and accept, we beseech Thee, all those
who truly repent and unfeignedly believe Thy Holy
Gospel. Grant us true repentance and Thy Holy
Spirit; that those things may please Thee which we
do at this present; and that the rest of our life hereafter
may be pure and holy; so that at the last we
may come to Thy eternal joy; through Jesus Christ
our Lord. &nbsp; Amen.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Lord's Prayer</span></h4>

<h4><span class="smcap">Prayer for the King's Majesty</span><br />

<small>(All standing)</small></h4>

<p>O Lord, our Heavenly Father, high and mighty,
King of kings, Lord of lords, the only Ruler of
princes, who dost from Thy throne behold all the
dwellers upon earth; most heartily we beseech Thee
with Thy favor to behold our most gracious Sovereign
Lord, King George; and so replenish him
with the grace of Thy Holy Spirit, that he may
alway incline to Thy will, and walk in Thy way;
Endue him plenteously with heavenly gifts; grant
him in health and wealth long to live; strengthen
him that he may vanquish and overcome all his
enemies; and finally, after this life, he may attain
everlasting joy and felicity; through Jesus Christ
our Lord. &nbsp; Amen.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Prayer for the Royal Family</span></h4>

<p>Almighty God, the fountain of all goodness, we
humbly beseech Thee to bless our gracious Queen
Mary, Alexandra the Queen Mother, Edward Prince
of Wales and all the Royal Family; Endue them
with Thy Holy Spirit; enrich them with Thy heavenly
grace; prosper them with all happiness; and
bring them to Thine everlasting kingdom; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. &nbsp; Amen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Prayer for Soldiers</span></h4>

<p>Grant, we beseech Thee, Almighty God, that we
who are called to the service of our Empire, may
ever remember the honour which we uphold and the
privilege which is entrusted to us, to defend our
Sovereign, our homes and our country. Enable us at
all times to do what is right, and so to conduct ourselves,
that we may bring no disgrace upon the
uniform which we wear, nor upon the flag under
which we serve. Make us faithful, brave and true
to our duty, and especially to Thee, our God, as
soldiers of Christ and soldiers of the King. Keep
us, defend us and save us at all times; fill our hearts
with courage and love, and may we never be
ashamed to confess Thee before men, as good soldiers
and servants of Thine. And this we ask for
the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord. &nbsp; Amen.</p>

<h3>INDIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE<br />
RECONSTRUCTION OF BROCK'S<br />
MONUMENT</h3>

<h5>(Communicated by the Editor.)</h5>


<p>The indignation aroused by the destruction of
the first monument erected to General Brock was
fully shared by the Indians of Ontario. Meetings of
the Bands were held at which expression was given
to the feelings which stirred their hearts. They
asked the Government to allow them to join with
the White Men in contributing to the Fund for the
reconstruction of the monument, and this having
been most cordially granted, a sum amounting to
&#163;207 10s. was raised among the Indians in sums
varying from &#163;7 10s. to &#163;15 and paid over to the
general fund on behalf of the following Bands:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Chippewas of the Upper Reserve, on the
River St. Clair.</p>

<p>The Chippewas of the Lower Reserve and Walpole
Island, on the River St. Clair.</p>

<p>The Hurons and Wyandotts of Amherstburg.</p>

<p>The Chippewas of the River Thames.</p>

<p>The Munsees of the River Thames.</p>

<p>The Oneidas of the River Thames.</p>

<p>The Six Nation Indians of the Grand River.</p>

<p>The Missisagua of the River Credit.</p>

<p>The Chippewas of the Saugeen River, Lake
Huron.</p>

<p>The Chippewas of the Township of Rama, Lake
Couchiching.</p>

<p>The Chippewas of Snake Island, Lake Simcoe.</p>

<p>The Missisagua of Alnwick, Rice Lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenumbq"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

and of Mud and Balsam Lakes.</p>

<p>The Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte.</p></div>

<p>The following petition from the Missisagua of
Rice Lake, shows the spirit in which the Indians
acted:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Samuel P. Jarvis</span>, <i>Esquire, Chief Superintendent
of Indian Affairs</i>.</p>

<p>"Father:<br />
"We have heard of the wicked attempt to destroy
the Monument of our old Chief, Sir Isaac Brock;
and are also informed of the intention of the White
Man to rebuild it.</p>

<p>"Father:<br />
"We respect the memory of the brave, and are
sorry to find that there are any who do not.</p>

<p>"Some of us fought on the same field on which
the gallant general fell. We then felt the same
sorrow in our hearts that our loyal brothers in
arms, the White Men, felt, and we still unite with
them in the deepest regret at our common loss.
These feelings urge us readily to contribute our
share to the expense of re-building that Monument
which was designed to perpetuate the fame of such
noble deeds.</p>

<p>"Father:<br />
"We, who are thus ready to assist in the present
exigency, will never be backward in testifying our
loyal principles by still more substantial proofs,
whenever our Great Mother, the Queen, shall lay
her commands upon us. We will never refuse to
hear her words. Our Great Fathers, her Royal predecessors,
have been very kind to her people. We
are not unthankful. We do not wish to be idle; but
whenever we may be called upon to defend the
honour and rights of the British Crown, we will
most heartily strain every nerve, and do all the
service in our power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<h2>APPENDIX V.</h2>

<h3>CAPTAIN JOSEPH BIRNEY</h3>

<h5>Contributed by J. L. Birney, Toronto, Son of Captain<br />
Joseph Birney, from whose Narrative these<br />
Statements have been Compiled.</h5>


<p>Captain Birney was born in Orange County,
in the State of New York, on the 1st of February,
1777.</p>

<p>In 1779 his father, William Birney, was killed at
the battle of Lackawack, New York, in suppressing
an Indian uprising, and upon their bereavement
his mother, with his sister, a child in arms, and
himself a child two years old, made her way
through the forest, sixty miles, to New York City.
In the year 1783 or 1784 he was baptized in Trinity
Church, New York City. When the British evacuated
New York, Captain Birney, with his family
and friends, went with the British to where now
is situated St. John, New Brunswick, and resided
there until 1801, when he came to Upper Canada,
and settled where Hamilton is to-day. While in
New Brunswick he taught the Duke of Kent to
skate, both of them often practising together on
St. John's River.</p>

<p>In Upper Canada Captain Birney entered into the
military life of the time. He was over six feet in
height, powerfully built, and was well fitted for
the stirring life then before him.</p>

<p>In 1812 he was Ensign in Captain Hatt's company,
which accompanied Sir Isaac Brock to
Detroit, and his commission as Ensign, signed by
Sir Isaac Brock, is now in possession of his son,
John L. Birney, of Toronto. Captain Birney was
present when General Brock first met Tecumseh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
and he often related how the General was impressed
with the wonderful personality of the great chief.</p>

<p>As Lieutenant he served in Captain Durand's company
of 5th Lincoln Militia at the Battle of Queenston
Heights. He was attached to Brock's staff
as a special aide, to supervise the laying of the
batteries. Shortly before the Canadians were
driven from the heights, General Brock found that
in firing at the Americans who were coming across
the river the bullets were flying short, and he gave
the order to Colonel Williams to cease firing, but
Colonel Williams, mistaking the order to mean
"retire," began to retire by Niagara. Sir Isaac
remarked, "That's effective," but Captain Birney,
noticing Colonel Williams' movement, remarked,
"But, General, you did not mean to retire!" "By
no means," answered Sir Isaac. "Oh, for one to
bring them back!" "May I go?" offered Birney.
"By all means go, Birney," ordered the General,
whereupon Captain Birney ran down the steep
slope of the heights as fast as he could. On the way
down he noticed the mullein stalks being cut off,
and stepping on a slippery spot he fell violently on
the broad of his back.</p>

<p>At this he heard a great cheer, and looking
up saw the cause of it all. The Americans were
in possession of a portion of the heights, and their
sharpshooters, thinking they had succeeded in intercepting
him in his errand, had set up a cheer, but
Birney was soon afoot, and came up with Colonel
Williams, who upon seeing Birney, called his men
to halt, and enquired, "What's the matter, Birney?
Orders from the General?" Birney, being entirely
out of breath, from his efforts and fall, could not
answer, and Colonel Williams further enquired,
"Did the General not order us to retire?" Birney
shook his head. "What, then?" asked Colonel Williams.
"To cease firing," Birney managed to whisper.
At this the Colonel uttered an oath and smote
himself a terrific blow on the forehead with his fist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
They had not returned far when they heard a voice
say "Halt!" and looking up they saw the General
and his men, they having been driven from the summit.
There was a short conference, when the General
decided to go around by St. David's and there
attack the enemy. But they had not gone far when
Birney, who was immediately behind the General,
heard a groan, and looking up saw the General
falling from his horse, and, rushing forward, he
assisted him to the ground. With a few parting
orders the General was dead.</p>

<p>After this Birney had to take command of his
own company, and with the rest they fell in order
and marched around the mountain by St. David's
and there surprised the Americans eating their
(the Canadians') breakfast, as the Americans had
surprised them earlier in the morning. And then
commenced the real fighting of the day. The
Americans after a hand-to-hand fight were charged
and driven out, many of them being forced over
heights into Niagara River. Captain Birney
used to remark that with his sword in one hand
and a broken gunbarrel in the other he led his
men in this charge, and it was a sorry day for any
American who came within his reach. Among the
many prisoners Captain Birney assisted in capturing
that day was his cousin, Captain Winfield
Scott, afterwards General Scott, who, after being
taken to York, was exchanged for prisoners.</p>

<p>Captain Birney led his company, the 5th Lincoln,
in the battle of Lundy's Lane in 1814, coming out
of it, as he did in all his engagements, without a
scratch.</p>

<p>He used to take pleasure in relating how, after
the Americans had been badly beaten and had made
a hasty retreat, leaving their men to be buried,
there was left behind a lone gunner who stuck to
his cannon. Birney and a number of his men
marched down upon this man for the purpose of
capturing the gun, and as they approached him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
three times did this gunner swing his torch with
the purpose of firing his gun, but each time he
drew back from the fuse and finally threw his
torch upon the ground. Birney said it was well
he did, as he and many of his men would not
have lived to tell the tale, as they were walking
directly in the face of the cannon. He also took
pride in telling how one Canadian cannon was
taken and retaken many times that night, while
lying in heaps around it were Canadians and
Americans who had fought and died bravely.</p>

<p>When the Rebellion of 1837 broke out Captain
Birney was the oldest officer surviving the troubles
of 1812-14. Being at that time over age he did
not wish to take any part in the fighting, feeling
he had served his country well and sufficiently up
to that time, and he felt in addition that through
favoritism many who had served under him had
been promoted over his head. However, through
the personal efforts of Sir Allan McNab and Colonel
Land he was persuaded to take command
of a company of the 3rd Gore Militia, which post
he held until about 1841, being actively engaged
in military affairs during all that period.</p>

<p>Some of his work at this time was the building
of the bridge for the troops to cross the water-gap
at Burlington Heights, and he also was engaged
in constructing the defence works on Burlington
Heights during the battle of Stoney Creek for use
in case of retreat. He was afterwards with his
company in charge of the 112 prisoners who were
held and tried at Hamilton.</p>

<p>When Captain Birney died, in 1873, being in his
96th year, he was the oldest living Mason in Canada,
having joined the Craft in 1803.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
